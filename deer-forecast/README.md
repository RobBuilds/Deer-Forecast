Deer Forecast is a weather-based whitetail activity predictor built for hunters, by a hunter. 
This project was created out of my passion for the outdoors, combining real-time weather data 
and AI to generate daily deer movement insights based on your exact location.

AI Forecast

Your results include a short, AI-generated deer activity forecast — including peak movement times for the day.

🏹 Why I Built This
As a bowhunter, I’ve always wanted a tool that blends real weather data with smart predictions for when and how deer are likely to move. This project is my attempt to combine my love for hunting with my background in software engineering — and give fellow hunters a useful resource they can trust.

☁️ Deployment
The AI portion of this app is deployed using Cloudflare Workers. When a user submits a location, 
the frontend sends weather data to a serverless Cloudflare Worker, which processes the request and 
returns a deer activity forecast generated by OpenAI’s GPT model.

This allows the app to stay lightweight, fast, and cost-effective — perfect for 
real-time predictions in the field.
